![Build Status](https://andremarques023.visualstudio.com/_apis/public/build/definitions/c98afab6-e9a0-4e74-85eb-4d27f9829548/24/badge "Build Status")

This extension provides diagnostic tasks to help you diagnose and profile build or release definitions. With these tasks, you can gather information (such as variable values) and troubleshoot common issues during the different stages of your pipeline.

## Usage

Currently, this extension has the following tasks:

* Log Variables - Logs predefined variables provided by Build or Release Management to the console.
* Update Build Number - Updates the build number for the current build.

## Log Variables

Team Build brings a number of predefined variables that can be used in build (and release) definitions and scripts. Variables are generated by the agent in the scope of a particular job (prior to it starting) or generated on the server side and sent to the agent as part of the job. 

This task logs these variables to the console. The following options are available:

* Agent variables.
* Build variables.
* Common variables.
* Release variables.
* System variables.

<sub>Note: Variable values are automatically logged when a release is in progress (at the Logs hub) by Release Management.</sub>

## Update Build Number

This task updates the build number. It uses a build logging command to emit the new number via standard output. The following options are available: 

* Build number - The build number to be set for the current build.
